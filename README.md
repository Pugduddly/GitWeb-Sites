This is a textbased browser, that supports pages with Color & Styling codes based off the built in Minecraft colorcodes.

You can view a list of all the current websites here: https://gitweb-js.glitch.me/allsites.html


# Website Creation Tutorial

2.  Name this file what you want to call your website.
    - for steps 1 and 2 please follow "Website Identification and Naming Rules".
3.  Add text to the file following "Website Formatting".
4.  Save the file.
